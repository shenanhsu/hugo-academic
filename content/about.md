title: About Me
---

I am a senior Data Science student at Brigham Young University- Idaho. In addition to my education, I worked as a Data Analytics for FamilySearch, where I apply my analytical skil by managing Chinese record/data, leading projects, providing feedback, and collaborating with vendors to increase the quality of works. I didn’t see myself as an intern, I took responsibility for all my assignments. This has resulted in about a 20% increase in the quality of vendors’ works. I gained trust from my supervisor to continue helping their new audit tool for my senior project topic. 
  

My greatest strength is in providing creative solutions for any situation. I like learning and asking questions to solve problems. I know the power of looking at things in different ways and always remaining positive. I deeply believe that creativity motivates others to be interested in what they are doing.
