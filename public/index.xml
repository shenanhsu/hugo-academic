      <description>I am a senior Data Science student at Brigham Young University- Idaho. In addition to my education, I worked as a Data Analytics for FamilySearch, where I apply my analytical skil by managing Chinese record/data, leading projects, providing feedback, and collaborating with vendors to increase the quality of works. I didn’t see myself as an intern, I took responsibility for all my assignments. This has resulted in about a 20% increase in the quality of vendors’ works.</description>
